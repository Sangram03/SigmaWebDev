### 🔍 Meaning:

This tells Express:

> "If someone requests a file (like `/style.css` or `/image.png`), check the `public` folder and send it back if it exists."

---

### ✅ Example Usage:

Suppose your project structure is like this:

```
project/
├── server.js
└── public/
    ├── index.html
    ├── style.css
    └── script.js
```

In your `server.js`:

```js
import express from 'express';
const app = express();

app.use(express.static("public"));

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on http://localhost:3000");
});
```

Now, when you open:

* `http://localhost:3000/index.html` → you’ll see `index.html` from the `public` folder.
* `http://localhost:3000/style.css` → returns the `style.css` file.
* `http://localhost:3000/script.js` → returns the JS file.

---

### 📦 Why Use It?

* To host static assets like **frontend HTML pages, CSS, JS, or images**.
* Keeps your backend focused on API logic while frontend files are served directly.
* Fast and efficient — no need to create separate routes for each file.

---

### 🧠 Tip:

You can also give a virtual path prefix:

```js
app.use("/static", express.static("public"));
```

Now files are served at `http://localhost:3000/static/index.html`.
